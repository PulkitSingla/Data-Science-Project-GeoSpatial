This interactive dashboard is designed for visualizing U.S. real estate data and market trends at multiple levels (i.e., national, state, county, and metro). The data sources include Real Estate Data from realtor.com and Cartographic Boundary Files from U.S. Census Bureau. Several open-source packages are used to process the data and generate the visualizations, e.g., streamlit, geopandas, leafmap, and pydeck.
